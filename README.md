# Alexandre Boving

I am a Belgian-Italian software engineer and AI enthusiast with expertise spanning the full software development life cycle â€” from design and architecture to implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. I specialize in both front-end and back-end engineering, with a strong focus on building scalable, reliable, and AI-driven systems.

My work integrates traditional software engineering with AI innovation, leveraging machine learning and deep learning to enhance automation, decision-making, and intelligent applications. I contribute to AI research and maintain repositories exploring advancements in neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing.

Outside of technology, I value sports and social interactions even more than computers.
