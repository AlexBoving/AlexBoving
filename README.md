# Alexandre Boving

I am a Belgian-Italian software engineer and data scientist with expertise across the full software development life cycle, covering design, architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. My work bridges traditional software engineering and artificial intelligence, combining front-end and back-end expertise with a strong focus on building scalable, reliable, and AI-driven systems.

I leverage machine learning and deep learning to enhance automation, decision-making, and intelligent applications. I also contribute to AI research and maintain repositories exploring advancements in neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing.

Outside of work, I value sports and social interactions even more than computers.
