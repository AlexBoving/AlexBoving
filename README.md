# Alexandre Boving
I'm Alexandre from Italy/Belgium, and I do web development as well as design and implementations of mobile applications. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks such as React and React Native. Besides of those occupations, I'm really into AI technologies and some of my related repos are available. Eventually, I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux and design in general.
