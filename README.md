I am Alexandre, a Belgian/Italian software engineer with expertise across the entire software life cycle, from design and architecture to implementation, testing, and deployment. I excel in both front-end and back-end engineering, with a strong focus on building scalable, reliable, and efficient systems.

My work is driven by a commitment to innovation continous improvment, and delivering high-quality software/AI solutions tailored to user needs.
